# Investigation of Empty Deck Info Fields

## Issue
The deck info card is not showing up because all deck info fields (description, footer, imageUrl, heading) are null in the database.

## Investigation Findings

1. **Code Review**:
   - The `hasDeckInfo` logic in DeckScreen.tsx is working correctly:
   ```typescript
   const hasDeckInfo = !!deckInfo?.description || !!deckInfo?.footer || !!deckInfo?.imageUrl;
   ```
   - The fields are properly defined as nullable in schema.prisma
   - The query in deck.ts correctly retrieves these fields

2. **Database Analysis**:
   - Queried all decks in the database
   - Found that ALL decks have null values for description, footer, imageUrl, and heading
   - This is a data issue, not a code issue

3. **Root Cause**:
   The deck info fields are not being populated during deck creation. This needs to be addressed by:
   a) Adding these fields to the deck creation form in the admin interface
   b) Populating these fields for existing decks
   c) Making these fields required if they should never be empty

## Next Steps
1. Add deck info fields to the deck creation form
2. Consider making these fields required in the schema if appropriate
3. Create a migration script to populate these fields for existing decks

## Testing Status
No code changes were made as this is an investigation PR. The issue is with data population, not code functionality.
